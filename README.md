# ghosh-ml-labs 🚀
Applied Data Science Portfolio by Dr. Bappaditya Ghosh

## 🌐 Focus Areas
- **Classical Machine Learning** – interpretable, calibrated, business-ready ML.
- **Deep Learning** – modern architectures for vision, sequence, and time-series.
- **Generative AI (GenAI)** – fine-tuning, RAG pipelines, knowledge assistants.
- **Agentic AI** – orchestration with LangGraph, secure tool use, adaptive workflows.
